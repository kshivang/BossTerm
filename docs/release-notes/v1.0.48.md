# Release Notes - v1.0.48

**Release Date:** 2025-12-24

## Highlights
This release delivers major performance improvements across all key metrics, with 30-100% speed increases in rendering, command latency, and throughput, plus comprehensive benchmarking infrastructure and enhanced state persistence for tabbed terminals.

## New Features
- **Comprehensive Benchmark Suite**: Added extensive terminal benchmark infrastructure with performance tracking for rendering, latency, and throughput
- **Performance Modes**: Introduced configurable performance modes (interactive, latency, balanced) to reduce command latency by 30-47%
- **External State Persistence**: Added `TabbedTerminalState` API for external state management and split state persistence
- **Active Working Directory API**: Added `getActiveWorkingDirectory()` to `TabbedTerminalState` for programmatic access to current working directory

## Bug Fixes
- **Split State Persistence**: Fixed split states not being properly saved in `TabbedTerminalState`
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Fixed split state memory leak on external state disposal
- **Thread Safety**: Made measurement cache thread-safe for multi-window scenarios
- **Linux Icon Display**: Added `StartupWMClass` to .desktop file for proper icon display on Linux
- **Release Workflow**: Auto-trigger release notes workflow after Release Build completes

## Improvements
