# Release Notes - v1.0.58

**Release Date:** 2025-12-28

## Highlights
This release introduces a powerful new programmatic input API that allows parent applications to send raw bytes and control sequences directly to terminal processes, enabling better automation and control capabilities.

## New Features
- **Programmatic Input API (#182)**: Added `sendInput()` API for sending raw bytes and control characters to terminal processes
  - `sendCtrlC()`: Send interrupt signal (Ctrl+C)
  - `sendCtrlD()`: Send EOF signal (Ctrl+D)
  - `sendCtrlZ()`: Send suspend signal (Ctrl+Z)
  - Available in both `EmbeddableTerminalState` and `TabbedTerminalState` with tab-specific overloads

## Bug Fixes
- **ByteArray Equality**: Fixed RawBytes to use regular class instead of data class to avoid equality comparison issues
- **FIFO Ordering**: Ensured proper FIFO ordering between `write()` and `sendInput()` operations
- **Encoding Issues**: Fixed sendInput() to use raw bytes to avoid character encoding problems

## Improvements
- **API Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation for the new sendInput() API

## Breaking Changes
None
